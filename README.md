Install gems by running

```
bundle install
```

Copy **application.yml.example**, **database.yml.example** as **application.yml**, **database.yml** and configure them.

You must visit [Facebook Developersâ€Ž](https://developers.facebook.com/) and [Twitter Apps](https://apps.twitter.com/) for register your application.
